    "# Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical machine learning problems often involve multiple features (or independent variables). **Simple linear regression**, which involves only one independent variable, is often used to illustrate the concept of regression. However, real-world problems usually involve more variables, and that's where **multiple linear regression** comes in.\n",

    "## What is Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Linear Regression** is a technique used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable (target) and two or more independent variables (features). It's an extension of **simple linear regression**, which deals with only one independent variable.\n",

    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Goal**: The goal of multiple linear regression is to predict a continuous target variable based on multiple input features.\n",
    "- **Regression Process**: During the fitting process, multiple linear regression tries to find the best hyperplane that can represent the relationship between the target and the independent variables.\n",
    "- **Hyperplane**: In multiple regression, the hyperplane is represented by a multi-dimensional space where each feature corresponds to a dimension, and the dependent variable is predicted based on the combination of all these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to predict the **house price** based on various independent variables such as **square footage, number of bedrooms, and age of the house**.\n",
    "\n",

    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot X_2 + \\beta_3 \\cdot X_3 + \\cdots + \\beta_n \\cdot X_n + \\epsilon\n",
